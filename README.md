# E-Davies Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description

I wanted to re-create my portfolio webpage using Bootstrap to showcase my work and skills to employer who are looking to hire. 

This has been achieved by:
* Using Bootstrap components to create a functional and responsive webpage
* Replacing my navbar with a Bootstrap component that responsively creates a dropdown menu on smaller screens:
